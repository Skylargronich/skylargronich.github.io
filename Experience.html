At Navina I analyzed marketing campaigns to build data-driven solutions and optimized channels at a healthcare AI startup. I also researched their competitors marketing data, prepared summary reports and presented findings to marketing team. I helped plan and market a virtual event, resulting in a 100% increase in registrants from the prior webinar.
